# Responsive HTML Helper
Add the old HTML document in the $sourceurl variable. Then visit html-helper.php in the browser. Right-click, view source and then copy and paste the newly formatted HTML into your working document.

The script does these things
- Makes sure you have an <html>, <head>, and <body> tag
- Puts important responsive meta tags into the head section
- Converts all table related tags into divs. (For sites that used a table layout). The table tags still keep their inline styles, so you'll need to convert them into the equivalent CSS and remove them from the HTML yourself.
